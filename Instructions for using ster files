Instructions for using .ster file to estimate EQ-5D-5L utility from KDQoL responses 
ster filesare ways of storing and loading the estimates from the model we have chosen to be the preferred model for the mapping function. 

Download the KDQoLmap.ster file into your working directory 
Open Stata
Set your working directory to the same file path you have saved the above file 
Ensure you have installed the aldvmm command in Stata by typing: 
net install st0401_1, from("http://www.stata-journal.com/software/sj16-4")

Preparing the data - in order for the ster file to work, you will need to have the data in the correct format
For this mapping function, you need the following: 
•	age10 – age divided by 10  
•	female - (0=male, 1=female)
•	pcs10 - physical component summary from SF-12 divided by 10  
•	mcs10 mental component summary from SF-12 divided by 10  
•	burden10 - burden domain from KDQoL divided by 10  
•	symptom10 – symptom domain from KDQoL divided by 10 
•	effects10 – effects domain from KDQoL divided by 10 
•	kdqoltotal50 – pcs + mcs + burden + symptom + effects divided by 50 

Running the model  
when your data is in the correct format, run the aldvmm command using the ster file. This is done by entering the following code: 
clear 
use “name of dataset with correctly formatted variables” 
estimates use “KDQoLmap.ster” 
aldvmm 
predict eq5d, outcome(all) 
sum eq5d 

This will create a new variable with the EQ-5D-5L predictions for each observation.
